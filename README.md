## What is the Web Experience Toolkit (WET-BOEW)?

See [github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew)

## What is Moodle LMS? 

If you are familiar with Content Management Systems (CMS) like WordPress™, Drupal™ or Joomla™, Moodle™ is similar except that it is specifically designed to support education through online and in-class e-learning activities.

One of the most popular Learning Management Systems (LMS) in the world, Moodle is a Free Open Source Software (FOSS) web-based application designed for those who would rather spend their time, money and efforts on developing effective e-learning courses instead of perpetual expensive yearly software licences costing tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. High priorities of the Moodle project team include things like accessibility, support for multiple languages and security.

## What is the WET-BOEW-MOODLE project?

The purpose of WET-BOEW-Moodle project on GitHub is to create an open source Moodle themes based on version 4.0.30 of the award winning WET-BOEW framework. The initial launch will feature the Government of Canada's GCWeb and GCIntranet themes. Other themes may eventually be added depending on interest and financing. Working towards WCAG 2.0 Level AA compliance is a high priority for this project. The theme will also feature configurable settings for Moodle administrators.

By using this theme, organizations to focus their limited educational/training budgets on delivering effective sustainable educational/e-learning content instead of expensive and never ending software licenses.

## What's new?

**Status:**
* We have completed initial development and specification design.
* We have made a lot of progress on the GCIntranet theme.
* We are starting development of the GCIntranet theme.
* We removed the deprecated pre-2019 WET-BOEW themes including Canada.ca, GC Web Usability, GC Intranet, WET-BOEW, OGPL.

TODO list:

* Resolve some conflicts with Boost base theme.
* Quality Assurance and WCAG 2.0 level AA testing (and fixing).
* Code cleanup.
* Update Working Examples demo site: [wet-boew-moodle.tngconsulting.ca](http://wet-boew-moodle.tngconsulting.ca/)
* Update screenshot
* Update documentation.
* Add new UI/UX features.
* Create splash page and 404 server page.
* Finish the WET-BOEW-Moodle Style Guide (considering moving this to the WET-BOEW-Moodle Widgets course)

## Interested in this project?

Let us know by [dropping us a note](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-moodle/issues/1). It's the best time to get involved when we are at the initial development stage.

We would especially love to hear from:
* People who are planning on or currently using Moodle within the Government of Canada or the private sector;
* Developers who would like to contribute to this project

If you have any ideas, suggestions or code to share, please [create a new separate issue](https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-moodle/issues) for each one.

## Why should I contribute?

There is a wasteful situation going on in this world, the duplication of time, money and effort. This is severely limiting creativity, innovation and evolution each time someone has to re-create the wheel. 

By contributing your ideas, you may see them get implemented and supported in future releases. Contributed code has a chance of being integrated into future releases of WET-BOEW-Moodle as well. Together with the modular nature of Moodle, this makes it a lot easier to upgrade when new releases of WET-BOEW-Moodle and Moodle become available.

If you are part of Government, education or other large corporations, you can save money by avoiding duplicate spending on development to achieve similar results. As an individual developer, you also get recognition for your contribution efforts.

## System Requirements

WET-BOEW-Moodle will initially be released for Moodle 3.7 (or 3.8) in fall of 2019. Details of [Web server, database and web browser requirements](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_3.7_release_notes#Server_requirements) can be found on Moodle.org. Support for other versions of Moodle may be added at a later date depending on the level of interest.

Note: The WET-BOEW-Moodle theme will also include web based mobile support on iOS and Android devices.

These specifications and requirements may change as development progresses.

* Changelog
* Installation
* Theme configuration
* Updating WET-BOEW-Moodle

The working examples demo site for the WET-BOEW-Moodle project is sponsored and maintained by TNG Consulting Inc.

## Limitations

* The theme has limited support for WET-BOEW widgets. To see the current state of WET-BOEW widget compatibility, download and install the [WET-BOEW-Moodle widgets](https://github.com/michael-milette/wet-boew-moodle-widgets) course in your instance of Moodle configured with a WET-BOEW-Moodle theme.
* Accessibility is a high priority for the WET-BOEW-Moodle project. However it is not perfect yet.
* This project does not attempt to correct accessibility issues which may exist in Moodle core code. In order to create a site that is WCAG 2.0 compliant, you will also need to address accessibility issues in Moodle itself.

We are looking for volunteers or financial support to do functional testing, language testing, accessibility testing and RTL testing.
